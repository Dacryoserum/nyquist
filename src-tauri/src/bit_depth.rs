//! Detects a "fake hi-res" file: content whose container declares a bit depth (e.g.
//! 24-bit) that its actual samples never use, because the real information behind it
//! never exceeded a narrower depth (e.g. 16-bit) — the file was zero-padded/upsampled,
//! not genuinely re-mastered. A different problem from the lossy-transcode detection in
//! `transcode_detect.rs`: this file may never have touched a lossy codec at all.
//!
//! ## Method: exact quantization-grid alignment, not a noise-floor/SNR estimate
//!
//! A tempting approach is comparing the measured noise floor to the theoretical
//! quantization SNR for N-bit PCM (~6.02*N dB) — deliberately not used here: it needs a
//! genuinely quiet passage to measure against (unreliable on brickwalled masters, exactly
//! the kind of file this feature also needs to work on) and depends on a formula this
//! project can't cite from an ITU/EBU standard the way LUFS can.
//!
//! Instead: if a file's real information never exceeded N bits, every decoded sample,
//! quantized back to the *container's declared* bit depth, is an exact multiple of the
//! N-bit quantization step — not approximately, exactly (up to float round-trip error).
//! This is checked directly rather than estimated, and reports nothing (`None`) rather
//! than guessing when the answer isn't clear-cut.
//!
//! ## Known false-negative (by design, not a bug)
//!
//! A file that was properly dithered before being padded to a wider container will *not*
//! align exactly to the narrower grid — dither intentionally adds sub-LSB noise, which is
//! exactly what defeats this check. That's an acceptable, honest gap: it means this
//! detector only ever fires on genuine, exact evidence (a lazy padding job with no
//! dithering — the common real-world case for careless fake-hi-res files), never on a
//! guess. See `.claude/skills/transcode-heuristic-validation/SKILL.md`.
