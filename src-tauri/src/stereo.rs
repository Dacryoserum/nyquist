//! Stereo image measurements: how the two channels relate to each other, overall and per
//! frequency band.
//!
//! This is reported information, **not** a transcode signal. That distinction is the whole
//! point of this module's existence, so it is worth stating plainly: lossy encoders do
//! leave stereo fingerprints — mid/side coding, and intensity stereo which collapses the
//! high bands to a single channel plus a scale factor — and measuring them was expected to
//! give `transcode_detect` an indicator independent of the lowpass. It did not. Measured
//! across this project's corpus, the high-band side/mid ratio of a LAME V0 or AAC 256
//! transcode sits within a decibel of its lossless source. Nothing here is wired into the
//! verdict, and nothing here should be without new evidence.
//!
//! What it is genuinely good for: telling a listener what they have. A "stereo" file that
//! is really dual-mono, a fake-wide master built from an out-of-phase duplicate, or a
//! mid/side balance that will collapse on a mono playback system are all real properties of
//! a file that this tool could otherwise not report.
