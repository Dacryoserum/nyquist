//! Searches for AAC long-block quantization-grid evidence in decoded PCM.
//!
//! Re-analysis at the encoder's window and alignment can expose unusually many near-zero
//! transform coefficients. This is a hypothesis test, not a mathematical proof of origin:
//! structured native signals can also have periodicities, and post-processing can erase
//! an encoder grid. A negative search never rules out AAC.
//!
//! Both sine and Kaiser–Bessel-derived (alpha = 4) windows are searched. Each winning offset
//! must exceed the robust-deviation threshold on the sweep AND on disjoint confirmation
//! frames, compared with control offsets on those same confirmation frames.
//!
//! Background: Kim & Rafii, "Lossy Audio Compression Identification", EUSIPCO 2018,
//! https://eurasip.org/Proceedings/Eusipco/Eusipco2018/papers/1570436395.pdf.
//! Our near-zero-count statistic differs from their adjacent log-energy-difference method;
//! the paper's accuracy is not this implementation's accuracy. See docs/detection-research.md.
//!
//! Scope: one energetic channel, 1024-coefficient long blocks. Short blocks, window
//! transitions, HE-AAC tools, resampling, added noise and edits can evade detection.
//! MP3's hybrid filterbank is not inverted by this transform. Scores are descriptive robust
//! deviations, not Gaussian tail probabilities; adding hypotheses requires new validation.
